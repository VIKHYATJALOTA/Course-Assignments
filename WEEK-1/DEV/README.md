# Week 1 Assignment: ElevenLabs Signup Clone

## Objective
To build ElevenLabs "Create an Account" page

## Key Learning Outcomes
* **Semantic HTML Structure**: mastered the use of nested `div` containers to organize form groups.
* **Flexbox Layouts**: used `display: flex` with `flex-direction: column` to manage the vertical stacking of the signup card.
* **Box Model Mastery**: implemented `box-sizing: border-box` to ensure padding doesn't interfere with defined element widths.
* **Typography**: integrated Google Fonts (Inter) and utilized `letter-spacing` and `-webkit-font-smoothing` for a premium tech aesthetic.
* **DRY CSS Principles**: utilized grouped selectors (e.g., `.box-2 a, .box-3 a`) to reduce code redundancy and improve maintainability.
